<v ->Hi, my name is Jennifer Eberhardt, and I'm the author</v>

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.650
of "Biased, Uncovering the Hidden Prejudice that

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.890
Shapes What We See, Think, and Do."

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.810
In my career as a social psychologist and professor

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.050
of psychology at Stanford University, I've dedicated myself

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.000
to researching and teaching about implicit bias,

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.330
what it is, where it comes from,

9
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.390
how it affects us, and how we can address it.

10
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.320
Implicit bias is not a new way of calling someone a racist.

11
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.080
In fact, you don't have to be a racist at all

12
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.790
to be influenced by it.

13
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.270
As I'll explain in depth later,

14
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.220
implicit bias is a kind of distorting lens

15
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.750
that's a product of both the architecture

16
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.300
of our brains and the disparities in our society.

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.190
Our ideas about race are shaped by the stereotypes

18
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.460
to which we are exposed on a daily basis,

19
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.760
and one of the strongest stereotypes

20
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.320
in American society associates blacks with criminality.

21
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.140
Here's where I would normally break out the graphs

22
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.790
and slides, but instead,

23
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.920
I'm gonna tell you a personal story.

24
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.920
A few years ago, I took my son Everett on a plane.

25
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520
He was five years old, wide-eyed

26
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.990
and trying to take it all in.

27
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.300
So he's looking around on the plane,

28
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.080
and he saw a black passenger and then said

29
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.860
hey, that guy looks like daddy.

30
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.510
Now, I look at the man,

31
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.420
and he doesn't look anything at all like daddy.

32
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.770
He looks nothing like his father.

33
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.420
I couldn't help but be struck by the irony,

34
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.890
the race researcher,

35
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.370
having to explain to her own black child

36
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.570
that not all black people look alike.

37
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.870
Just as I was about to begin lecturing my son,

38
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.910
he looked up at me, and he says

39
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.920
I hope he doesn't rob the plane.

40
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.900
Why would you say that, I asked, as gently as I could,

41
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.200
though I was on the brink of being upset.

42
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.530
You know daddy wouldn't rob a plane.

43
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.460
Yes, yes, I know.

44
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.250
Well, why would you say that?

45
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.973
Everett looked up at me with a sad face.

46
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.933
He says I don't know why I said that.

47
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.290
I don't know why I was thinking that.

48
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.670
Even with no malice,

49
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.240
this black crime association made its way

50
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.193
into the mind of my five-year-old child,

51
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.060
just as it has made its way into all of us.

52
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.420
I wrote this book to show the many surprising places

53
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.640
and ways that implicit bias affects

54
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.820
all sorts of decisions we make

55
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.600
during the normal course of our lives,

56
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.420
the homes we buy, the people we hire,

57
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.590
the way we treat our neighbors.

58
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.730
People can hold biases based

59
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.200
on all sorts of characteristics, skin, color, age, weight,

60
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.210
ethnic origin, accent, disability, height, gender,

61
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.860
but neither our evolutionary path nor our present culture

62
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.870
dooms us to be held hostage by these biases.

63
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.270
Change requires a kind of open-minded attention

64
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.320
that is well within our reach.

65
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.090
There are successful approaches we can learn from

66
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.800
and new ways of thinking we can build upon.

67
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.890
In this series of videos,

68
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.310
I'm going to take you on a journey I have taken,

69
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.140
to share the unexpected findings I have uncovered,

70
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.770
the stories I have heard, the struggles I have encountered,

71
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.199
and the triumphs that have inspired me.
